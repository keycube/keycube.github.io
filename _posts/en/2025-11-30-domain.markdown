The keycube finally has its own place on the internet, and it feels great to say it: the project now lives at **[keycube.org](https://keycube.org)**.

Nothing else changes behind the scenes. The site is still hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages), and the classic [keycube.github.io](https://keycube.github.io) link continues to work just fine. It now redirects smoothly to the new domain, so you can use whichever link you prefer.

This new domain makes the project easier to find, easier to share and, honestly, a bit more real. It’s a small step, but it feels like an important one in the journey of the keycube.
