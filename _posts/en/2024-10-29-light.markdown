The keycube is an innovative interface with **backlit keys** arranged around a cube, and managing its lighting can create dynamic and engaging visual experiences. A small development library was designed to simplify the management of these lighting effects while offering a wide range of animations.

Predefined effects like **rainbow transitions**, where colors smoothly move across the cube, and the **breathing effect**, where light intensity gently fluctuates, help create calming or engaging visual feedback. Another popular effect, **the ripple**, triggers a wave of light across the keys when a single key is activated.

This library provides an intuitive and flexible way to control the keycube's lighting, with easy customization options for colors and transitions. It opens up exciting possibilities for enhancing interactions with this unique interface.

For more technical details about the light management library developed by Thibaut Breton as part of an academic project (in fall 2023), visit the dedicated GitHub [repository](https://github.com/keycube/lightManager).
