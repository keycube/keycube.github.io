The keycube family is expanding! Introducing the **baby keycube** (**bbk3**), a compact version of the original, featuring just one key per face. But it's not just one device, itâ€™s a pair of twins! These two units magnetically snap together to form a single, versatile controller.

The first functional prototypes were developed by **Adrien Cartelot** as part of an academic project (autumn 2023). Since then, the 3D models have been refined and simplified using [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org), a free and open-source programmer-oriented solid-modeling software. Before reaching this stage, early cardboard prototypes and design iterations were made a couple of years ago.

Finally, structure and keycaps were entirely 3D-printed (with resin).

... and a thin layer of clear paint was applied to any surface meant to be touched, ensuring a smoother tactile experience.
