Weâ€™re excited to announce that the official **keycube** website is now available in both **French** and **English**.

This step feels natural, because the keycube itself was born at the crossroads of two French-speaking worlds: **France** and **Quebec**. The first prototypes, ideas, and discussions that shaped the project grew out of research conducted in these two regions. Having the website in both languages is a way of recognizing that history and keeping a strong connection with the communities that helped give life to the keycube.

At the same time, sharing the site in English opens the door to a wider international audience, making it easier for more people to discover the project, learn from it, and contribute.

The keycube has always been about openness: open research, open hardware, and open sharing of ideas. Making the site accessible in both French and English is one more step in that direction.
