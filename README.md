# Introduction

The KeyCube is not just a keyboard; it's a transformative device that takes the familiar form of a cube. Our mission is to cultivate collaboration and exploration around these unique devices, combining the functionality of a keyboard with a structural metamorphosis into the platonic solid that is a cube.
