    <h2 id="what-is-keycube-">WHAT IS KEYCUBE ?</h2>

<p>Our objective is to foster collaboration around the keycubes, essentially devices reminiscent of a keyboard that have undergone a structural metamorphosis into the platonic solid that is a cube.</p>

<p>A keycube facilitates and encourages the user to move around while typing, whether itâ€™s for text input in spatial computing environments, to maintain an active lifestyle, or simply to relish the joy of typing in various settings.</p>
